# My approach towards this task

For this task, I have utilized the Papergrid theme to create a simpler design for this webpage. Here, I have employed two Markdown (.md) files and one .toml file in the backend section of the webpage that you are currently reading. The main resources that helped me in completing the task were Google and YouTube. Even though this was one of the easiest tasks in the praveshan, it took me almost 4-5 attempts to complete it in one go. The reason for the failure of previous attempts was due to a lack of knowledge and research. Later, on my 5th attempt, thanks to previous experience and appropriate research, I finally managed to complete this task, and I'm very happy about it.
